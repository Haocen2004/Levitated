## Creating issues or pull requests
1.Follow the templates provided
2.For creating issues, think twice and do your own research before doing so, avoid submitting any issue that only occurs when you did something outside of the game. For example, deleting an existing mod or changing a default config option.
3.Also, when submitting issues with a particular mod, you should submit an issue to that mod's github page first, then link that issue to your issue submitted to this modpack.
4.When creating an issue, describe the problem/suggestion as clear as you can in English, if you do not speak English well, it's okay. But please make sure others can at least understand you, and avoid typos if you can.
5.When submitting a pull request, make sure that the file structure stays intact. For configs, make sure that the config does load first. For textures, add new directories as needed. For scripts, add comments and use loops instead of plain copy & paste. For localization, make sure the file name is correct and can be loaded. Finally, describe your desired changes clearly in understandable English.
6.We welcome everyone who is willing to make contributions, but the development team reserves the rights to close any issue/pull request that is creating more trouble than it solves.
